`Huawei Y9 Prime (2019)` is the first pop-up selfie camera phone manufactured by Huawei. The big advantage of this design is that we are going to have a max vision `6.59` inches display. It means more comfortable viewing experience and of course a good news for perfectionists that the annoying tiny notch is finally gone. The motorized pop-up front camera looks stylish and facny. The back side comes with an elegant gradient design which looks quite premium. However, the material is plastic. The display has some sort of light protection, but there is no Gorilla Glass certification. So, if you want to feel fully confident, you should buy an extra protection for the display. Full `HD+` LTPS IPS LCD quality should feel excellent to look at.

The performance is just right for smooth multitasking, modern day gaming and overall usage with Huawei’s own `Hisilicon Kirin 710F chipset and 4 GB RAM. 4000 mAh battery` is also a fair and up to date deal.

`Both front and back camera quality is pretty adequate` for the pricing. Photos should looks crips with vibrant colors with fine edge detection. There is Full HD video recording without any stabilization for both cameras. You may also notice lack of details when there isn’t enough light.

There is a `fast fingerprint sensor and face unlock for security`. Huawei EMUI 9 with Android Pie v9.0 should also give a pretty stable, smooth and secure experience. There is no dedicated MicroSD slot, which means you can either use dual SIM or a single SIM and a MicroSD card at the same time. Huawei Y9 Prime (2019) comes with USB Type-C.
